# react-first
This is my first react js project. 

# Inside that directory, you can run several commands:
### Starts the development server.
```sh
  npm start
```
### Bundles the app into static files for production.
```sh
npm run build
```
 * To run production build locally
	1. npm install -g serve
	2. serve -s build 
	3. http://localhost:5000/

### Starts the test runner.
```sh
  npm test
```

### Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can not go back!
```sh
  npm run eject
```
