    Bundles the app into static files for production.
		- To run production build locally
			1. npm install -g serve
			2. serve -s build 
			3. http://localhost:5000/

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can not go back!
